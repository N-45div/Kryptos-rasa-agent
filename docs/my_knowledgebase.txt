## KEY ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORKS

### MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Analysis
The MVRV ratio compares an asset's market capitalization to its realized capitalization. This metric helps identify when an asset may be overvalued or undervalued.

- MVRV > 3.5: Market potentially overheated, increased sell pressure likely
- MVRV between 1.0-2.0: Neutral territory, moderate risk/reward
- MVRV < 1.0: Potentially undervalued, historically favorable entry points

### Slippage Analysis
Slippage refers to the difference between expected price and execution price during trading. Monitoring slippage provides critical insights into market liquidity.

Interpretation framework:
- Low slippage (<0.5%): High liquidity, efficient market conditions
- Moderate slippage (0.5-2%): Normal market conditions for mid-cap assets
- High slippage (>2%): Low liquidity, potential for price manipulation

Example analysis: "Ethereum's slippage metrics show a 0.3% average deviation on major exchanges for $100K orders, indicating excellent liquidity conditions compared to historical averages of 0.7%."

### Cross-Exchange Arbitrage Analysis
Monitoring price differences of the same cryptocurrency across different exchanges to identify profitable trading opportunities.

Interpretation framework:
- Minimal spread (<0.1%): Efficient market, high liquidity, limited arbitrage potential
- Moderate spread (0.1-0.5%): Standard market conditions, potential for profitable trades after fees
- Large spread (>0.5%): Significant arbitrage opportunity, requires analysis of withdrawal/deposit times and fees

### News Sentiment Impact Assessment
Analyzing the latest crypto news and quantifying potential market impact through sentiment analysis and historical correlation patterns.

Interpretation framework:
- Breaking regulatory news: High impact, potential for significant price movement
- Protocol upgrades: Medium impact, generally positive but priced in gradually
- Partnership announcements: Variable impact, requires analysis of actual utility vs. marketing
- Market structure changes: High impact, especially for exchange or infrastructure changes
